Hey! I'm **J. Alonso Guerra**, a backend engineer from Colombia who's been building distributed systems and cloud-native applications with **Go** for the past few years.

I'm passionate about designing systems that handle real scale — from messaging platforms processing millions of daily interactions to billing engines with real-time event processing. I enjoy the challenge of making things fast, reliable, and elegant under the hood.

### What I do

I currently work as a **Senior Backend Engineer** at [Ipcom](https://ipcom.ai/), where I design event-driven architectures on GCP, build real-time reporting systems, and lead the backend development of AI-powered voicebot platforms. Before that, I worked on microservices modernization for [Falabella](https://amaris.com/) (one of Latin America's largest retailers) and built digital security platforms at [Virtual Padlock](https://virtualpadlocks.com/).

My daily toolkit revolves around **Go, Kubernetes, Redis, NATS**, and cloud platforms like **GCP** and **AWS**. I'm a firm believer in clean architecture, domain-driven design, and keeping things simple until complexity is truly needed.

### Beyond code

When I'm not writing Go, you'll find me exploring cloud certifications, tinkering with AI agents, or reading about system design patterns. I'm also a native Spanish speaker with professional English — I've worked remotely with teams across Colombia, Chile, Peru, and beyond.
